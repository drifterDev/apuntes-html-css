      "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men
      who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
      moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
      trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
      in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
      through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and
      easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
      untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
      best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in
      certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
      of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated
      and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these
      matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure
      other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
